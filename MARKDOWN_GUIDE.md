# Markdown Guide for Blog Editor

## Line Breaks and Paragraphs

In standard Markdown (which this blog uses):

### Single Line Break
Pressing Enter once creates a single newline, which is **ignored** in the rendered output.
```
This is line one
This is line two
```
Renders as: This is line one This is line two

### Paragraph Break
Press Enter **twice** to create a new paragraph:
```
This is paragraph one

This is paragraph two
```
Renders as two separate paragraphs.

### Force Line Break
To force a line break within the same paragraph, add **two spaces** at the end of a line:
```
This is line one  
This is line two
```
Renders with a line break but in the same paragraph.
