> how to test.. how will it work

⏺ I'll show you how to test the RSS/Atom feed functionality and explain how it works.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create a guide for testing RSS feeds
     ☐ Show how to test with feed readers
     ☐ Demonstrate browser testing
     ☐ Test category and tag feeds

⏺ How to Test RSS/Atom Feeds

  1. Browser Testing

  Most modern browsers can display RSS/Atom feeds:

⏺ Bash(echo "Main feed: http://localhost:4000/feed.xml")
  ⎿  Main feed: http://localhost:4000/feed.xml

⏺ Open these URLs in your browser:
  - Main feed: http://localhost:4000/feed.xml
  - RSS feed: http://localhost:4000/rss.xml (same content)
  - OPML file: http://localhost:4000/feeds.opml

  2. Command Line Testing

⏺ Bash(curl -s http://localhost:4000/feed.xml | xmllint --format - | head -30)
  ⎿  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <generator uri="https://github.com/hrishikeshchoudhari/blog">Phoenix Blog</generator>
       <link rel="alternate" href="http://localhost:4000"/>
     … +26 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ 3. Test Category/Tag/Series Feeds

  Let me check what categories, tags, and series exist:

⏺ Bash(docker-compose exec blog bash -c "echo 'Blog.Landing.all_tags() |> Enum.map(& &1.slug) |> IO.inspect()' | iex -S
      mix" | grep -A 5 "\[")
  ⎿  Error: Command timed out after 5s time="2025-06-14T17:38:53+01:00" level=warning
     msg="/Users/rishi/code/blog/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove
      it to avoid potential confusion"
         warning: Phoenix.Component.live_flash/2 is deprecated. Use Phoenix.Flash.get/2 in Phoenix v1.7+
         │
      39 │     email = live_flash(socket.assigns.flash, :email)
         │             ~
         │
         └─ lib/blog_web/live/users_login_live.ex:39:13: BlogWeb.UsersLoginLive.mount/3

         warning: unused alias Repo
         │
     … +53 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

⏺ Let me use curl to check the OPML file which lists all available feeds:

⏺ Bash(curl -s http://localhost:4000/feeds.opml | xmllint --format - | grep -E "xmlUrl|text=" | head -20)
  ⎿      <outline text="All Feeds" title="All Feeds">
           <outline type="rss" text="Main Feed" title="Main Feed" xmlUrl="http://localhost:4000/feed.xml"
     htmlUrl="http://localhost:4000"/>
           <outline text="Categories" title="Categories">
           <outline text="Series" title="Series">
     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! Here are the available feeds you can test:

  Available Feeds:

  1. Series feed: http://localhost:4000/series/second-series/feed.xml
  2. Tag feeds:
    - http://localhost:4000/tag/firsts/feed.xml
    - http://localhost:4000/tag/seconds/feed.xml

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create a guide for testing RSS feeds
     ☒ Demonstrate browser testing
     ☒ Test category and tag feeds
     ☐ Show how to test with feed readers

⏺ 4. Test with Feed Readers

  You can test the feeds with various RSS readers:

  Desktop Apps:

  - Mac: NetNewsWire (free), Reeder
  - Windows: FeedDemon, RSS Bandit
  - Linux: Liferea, Akregator

  Web-based Readers:

  - Feedly (https://feedly.com)
  - Inoreader (https://www.inoreader.com)
  - The Old Reader (https://theoldreader.com)

  How to Add to a Feed Reader:

  1. Copy the feed URL (e.g., http://localhost:4000/feed.xml)
  2. In your feed reader, look for "Add Feed" or "Subscribe" button
  3. Paste the URL and confirm

  5. Test Feed Auto-Discovery

  Browsers and feed readers can auto-discover feeds from your blog pages:

⏺ Bash(curl -s http://localhost:4000 | grep -E "application/(atom|rss)" | head -5)
  ⎿      <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Blog Feed" href="/feed.xml">
         <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Blog RSS" href="/rss.xml">

⏺ 6. Validate Your Feeds

  Use online validators to ensure your feeds are properly formatted:

  1. W3C Feed Validator: https://validator.w3.org/feed/
  2. FeedValidator.org: http://www.feedvalidator.org/

  To validate locally:

⏺ Bash(curl -s http://localhost:4000/feed.xml | xmllint --noout - && echo "Feed is valid XML!")
  ⎿  Feed is valid XML!

⏺ 7. Test Dynamic Updates

  When you add new posts, they automatically appear in the feeds:

⏺ Bash(curl -s http://localhost:4000/feed.xml | grep -c "<entry>")
  ⎿  10

⏺ The feed currently has 10 entries.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create a guide for testing RSS feeds
     ☒ Show how to test with feed readers
     ☒ Demonstrate browser testing
     ☒ Test category and tag feeds

⏺ How RSS/Atom Feeds Work in Your Blog

  Feed Generation Flow:

  1. User requests feed → /feed.xml
  2. Router → Directs to FeedController
  3. Controller → Calls Blog.Feed.generate_main_feed()
  4. Feed Context →
    - Fetches posts from database
    - Builds Atomex feed structure
    - Converts to XML using custom generator
  5. Response → XML sent to client

  Key Features:

  - Automatic Updates: New posts automatically appear in feeds
  - Category/Tag/Series Filtering: Specialized feeds for content types
  - OPML Export: Allows users to subscribe to all feeds at once
  - Feed Discovery: Browsers can auto-detect available feeds
  - Configurable: Feed author, email, and limits can be set in config

  Production Configuration:

  In production, update your environment variables:
  FEED_AUTHOR="Your Name"
  FEED_EMAIL="your@email.com"
  PHX_HOST="yourdomain.com"

  The feeds will automatically use HTTPS URLs in production.


  ==============


For your Hetzner deployment with the user registration prevention:

  Hetzner Docker Deployment Instructions

  Initial Setup (First Time)

  # SSH into your Hetzner server
  ssh your-server

  # Clone your repo
  git clone https://github.com/hrishikeshchoudhari/blog.git
  cd blog

  # Create .env file for production
  cat > .env << EOF
  ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false  # Only for initial setup!
  PHX_HOST=yourdomain.com
  SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(mix phx.gen.secret)
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://blog:yourpassword@localhost/blog_prod
  FEED_AUTHOR=Your Name
  FEED_EMAIL=your@email.com
  EOF

  Alternative: Use Mix Task

  # Start containers without registration enabled
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

  # Create admin user via command line
  docker-compose exec blog mix blog.setup_admin your@email.com yourpassword

  This way, registration is permanently disabled on your Hetzner server after initial setup.

  The mix task only needs to be run once during initial setup. Here's what happens when you push updates:

  Update Workflow on Hetzner

  Normal Updates (Code Changes)

  # SSH into your Hetzner server
  ssh your-server
  cd blog

  # Pull latest changes
  git pull

  # Rebuild and restart containers
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

  # Run any new migrations
  docker-compose exec blog mix ecto.migrate

  What Persists Between Updates

  1. PostgreSQL Data ✅
    - User accounts persist in Docker volumes
    - All posts, drafts, tags, etc. remain
    - Database is NOT reset on updates
  2. Environment Variables ✅
    - Your .env file stays unchanged
    - ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false remains set
    - No need to recreate admin user
  3. Uploaded Files ✅
    - Media uploads in volumes persist

  When You DO Need to Re-run Setup

  Only in these rare cases:

  1. Complete Server Rebuild
  # If you destroy volumes
  docker-compose down -v  # This deletes everything!
  2. Database Corruption/Loss
    - Restore from backup instead
    - Or re-run setup task as last resort
  3. Moving to New Server
    - Better to migrate database
    - Or backup/restore

  Recommended Update Script

  Create this on your Hetzner server:

  #!/bin/bash
  # update.sh
  cd /path/to/blog
  git pull
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
  docker-compose exec blog mix ecto.migrate
  echo "Update complete!"

  Then updates are just:
  ssh your-server
  ./update.sh

  Database Backup Strategy

  To avoid ever needing to re-run setup:

  # Create backup script
  cat > backup.sh << 'EOF'
  #!/bin/bash
  DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
  docker-compose exec -T blog pg_dump -U blog blog_prod > backup_$DATE.sql
  # Keep only last 7 days of backups
  find . -name "backup_*.sql" -mtime +7 -delete
  EOF

  # Add to crontab for daily backups
  crontab -e
  # Add: 0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh

  TL;DR

  - First time only: Run setup task to create admin user
  - Every update: Just pull code and restart containers
  - User data persists automatically between updates
  - Registration stays disabled via environment variable

  Your admin account and all data remain intact across updates! 🎉

    - Run at 2 AM daily
    - Keep last 7 days locally

  Phase 2: Google Drive Sync (Day 2)

  1. Install rclone
    - Configure with Google Drive
    - One-time browser authentication
    - Test manual upload
  2. Automate uploads
    - Upload after each backup
    - Simple rclone sync command
    - Delete local files older than 7 days

  Phase 3: Retention Setup (Day 3)

  1. Folder structure in Google Drive
    - /BlogBackups/daily/ (keep 7)
    - /BlogBackups/weekly/ (keep 4)
    - /BlogBackups/monthly/ (keep 12)
  2. Simple retention script
    - Move Sunday backup to weekly
    - Move 1st of month to monthly
    - Delete old files based on count

  Phase 4: Basic Monitoring (Day 4)

  1. Email notifications

  - Complex monitoring
  - Automated restore testing

  Total setup time: ~2-3 hours
  Monthly maintenance: ~30 minutes for restore test

  This gives you:
  - Daily backups
  - Automatic offsite storage
  - 1 year of backup history
  - Zero additional cost (using your Google plan)
