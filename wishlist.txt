  Quick Wins to Implement First:

  1. RSS Feed - Essential for any blog
  2. Image Upload Integration - You already have UploadLive
  3. Search - Basic PostgreSQL full-text search
  4. SEO Meta - Add meta description field to posts
  5. Reading Time - Simple calculation based on word count
  6. Pagination - For home page and tag pages
  7. Auto-save - For the editor (every 30 seconds)
  8. Social Sharing - Just needs frontend buttons

  Would you like me to implement any of these features? I'd recommend starting with RSS feeds and image uploads since they're fundamental for a modern blog.
